int i;

//This can be done by making use of the XOR operator.

//Lets say we have an array of size 5: 4, 3, 1, 2, 2

//Which are at the index:   0, 1, 2, 3, 4

//Now do an XOR of all the elements and all the indices.

// We get 2, which is the duplicate element.
 
//This happens because, 0 plays no role in the XORing.

// The remaining n-1 indices pair with same

//n-1 elements in the array and the only unpaired element

// in the array will be the duplicate.
